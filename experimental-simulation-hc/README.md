## How to run the code

Prerequisites: Python >= 3.10.9 < 3.13, numpy >= 1.23.5, pandas >= 1.5.3, sklearn 1.2.2, matplotlib >= 3.7.0.

        cd src
        python ./neel_data_analysis.py

Artifacts: the folder ./plots will be created. You'll find all the plots we included in the 24-month deliverable therein. Additionally, some lines with the best fit coefficients and some goodness-of-fit metrics will be plotted on the terminal.
