# Training data description

- The training data has been created using micromagnetic simulations
- A hysteresis loop for a cube of 50nm edge length was computer for a set of material parameters A, Ms, K
- XXX add details 
  - on mesh
  - simulation
  - distribution of material parameters / features (this could also go into the model description)


# Regeneration of training data

- to recreate the training data, the scripts in XXX can be used
- XXX comment on needed software
